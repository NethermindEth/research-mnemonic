Take a secret phrase and apply Shamir Secret Sharing to encode it into n secret phrases.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Take a secret phrase and apply Shamir Secret Sharing to encode it into n secret phrases. 

Using Shamir Secret Sharing, a secret phrase with \char`\"{}nw\char`\"{} words can be encoded into n secret phrases, each with \char`\"{}nw\char`\"{} words as well. Before encoding, a threshold parameter t (with t\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}=n) is defined, so that only t shares are required for the reconstruction of the original secret. (To reconstruct the secret, use the script reconstruct.\+py provided in this package.)\hypertarget{namespacecreate__shares_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysubsubsection{Requisites}\label{namespacecreate__shares_autotoc_md0}
1) Before running this script, a dictionary of words to encode secret phrases, with the name \char`\"{}wordlist.\+txt\char`\"{}, must be provided in the same folder as the script. This dictionary must\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Have 2$^\wedge$nb words, where nb is an integer (so that each word represents an nb-\/bit number)
\item Be a .txt file where each line has a single word.
\end{DoxyItemize}

This package comes pre-\/loaded with BIP-\/39\textquotesingle{}s 2048-\/word dictionary.

2) The secret phrase to be shared should\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Have between 3 and 60 words.
\item Have only words that are contained in the dictionary \char`\"{}wordlist.\+txt\char`\"{}.
\item Be written in a single line, with each word separated by only a space.
\end{DoxyItemize}

By default, the secret that will be encoded is read from a .txt file called \char`\"{}secret.\+txt\char`\"{}, to be located in the same folder as this script. (The secret may also be provided right in the command line at execution--see below).\hypertarget{namespacecreate__shares_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsubsection{Execution and inputs}\label{namespacecreate__shares_autotoc_md1}
This script should be called from the command line, with the following mandatory inputs (flags)\+:

-\/n\+: (integer) Number of shares that will be generated from the secret phrase. -\/t, --threshold\+: (integer) Minimum number of shares that will be required at reconstruction.

The following flags are optional\+:

-\/s, --secret\+: (string) Allows for either of the following options\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Specify the secret phrase directly on the command line.
\item Specify a custom file path to a .txt file with the secret. (In either case, the secret must abide by the same format considerations stated above) -\/v, --verbose\+: If this flag is used, the generated shares are verbose (see \char`\"{}outputs\char`\"{} below.)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{namespacecreate__shares_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsubsection{Outputs}\label{namespacecreate__shares_autotoc_md2}
During execution, the /shares folder is emptied, and its contents are replaced with the following JSON files\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item reconstruction\+\_\+data.\+json\+: Contains the following entries\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item total\+\_\+shares\+: Number of shares n generated during encoding
\item threshold\+: Threshold t representing the minimum number of shares needed for reconstruction.
\item primitive\+\_\+poly\+: Primitive polynomial used to generate the Galois field used for encryption; necessary for decryption. For more details, please read modules/shamir.\+py
\item dictionary\+: A copy of the contents of the dictionary wordlist.\+txt
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item share\+\_\+i.\+json (for 1\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}=i\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}=n)\+: Contains the following entries\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item id\+: ID number i, with 1\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}=i\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}=n, identifying the share.
\item share\+: list of words, one of the n secret phrases that the original secret was encoded into. Remark\+: if the --verbose flag was used at runtime, each of the JSON shares will also contain the reconstruction data.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The shares are also printed on the command line.
